    "Any Fortran source file that incorporates other software through the `use` statement **must** be built with the same Fortran compiler as those other sources. It is then usually required to build Fortran software and interfaces with the **same compiler**. Building software with Hipfort requires the following software installed and ready to go:\n",

    "* A GFortran compiler that is newer than 7.5.0. GFortran appears to be the only one that works at the moment, but this may change in future. \n",
    "* The ROCM stack installed. See [here](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/en/latest/) for latest installation info.\n",
    "    * If you have an integrated graphics card from AMD you still might be able to use HIP. With my Radeon 680M i've had a good experience if I **don't** install the `amdgpu-dkms` package and just use the open source compute driver in the Linux kernel.\n",
    "    * If hipfort is installed with the package manager during the installation of ROCM, you will probably need to remove it. Every unique Fortran compiler that you use must have a corresponding installation of Hipfort.\n",

    "HIP language support was formally introduced in CMake, version 3.21. This means you can set HIP as the language for kernel sources and the compiler will choose the necessary flags. Until version 3.28 of CMake though, the AMD backend was the only one that was supported by the HIP language with CMake. Since HIP on NVIDIA is just a thin wrapper over CUDA calls, an approach that seems to resolve the problem is to compile kernel sources with the **HIP language** on an AMD backend, and compile these **same kernel sources** as the **CUDA language** on an NVIDIA backend. Within a `CMakeLists.txt` file you can define the mutually exclusive pairs of macros (`__HIP_PLATFORM_HCC__`, `__HIP_PLATFORM_AMD__`) and (`__HIP_PLATFORM_NVCC__`,`__HIP_PLATFORM_NVIDIA__`) as switches for choosing the backend libraries to use from `hip_runtime.h`.\n",
