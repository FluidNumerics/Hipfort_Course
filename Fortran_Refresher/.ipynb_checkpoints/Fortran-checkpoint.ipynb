    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran was developed in the 1950's as a purpose built language for STEM applications. It is a good language to use for high performance computing because it is **easy** to understand, highly performant, and comes with a first-rate array implementation. Furthermore, the language has access to both thread-level and accelerator-assisted paralleism via extensions such as OpenMP and OpenACC, as well as access to process-level parallelism with a message passing library.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that older versions of the Fortran standard (i.e Fortran 77 and earlier) have archaic features and idiosyncrasies that may discourage folks with training in modern coding techniques. However, like other standard programming languages such as C++, the standard is under active development, and modern Fortran programs can even be expressed in object-oriented coding styles. Some of the benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Longevity, Fortran will be around as a standard for a long time.\n",
    "* First-rate multi-dimensional array implementation. Arrays of up to seven dimensions are supported, with easy **numpy-like** array access.\n",
    "* High performance. Compilers can optimize Fortran code so that it runs very quickly.\n",
    "* Compiler-optimized memory management. Compilers are free to organise and manage memory allocations in optimal ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential drawbacks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objects are passed to subroutines and functions by reference as the default. This potentially has impacts for memory safety.\n",
    "* Poor string handling and concatenation.\n",
    "* Memory alignment complexities when interfacing Fortran with C\n",
    "* No central website for the Fortran standard\n",
    "* Finding expertise in Fortran is difficult\n",
    "\n",
    "## Teaching method\n",
    "\n",
    "This teaching module does not aim to provide an exhaustive introduction to Fortran. Instead we aim to cover concepts that are helpful when using Fortran code with the [Hipfort](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/hipfort/en/latest/) interface to AMD's [HIP](https://rocm.docs.amd.com/projects/HIP/en/latest/) GPU library and runtime. We do this using a simple tensor addition example. If **A**, **B**, and **C** are tensors of rank 1, then at each index $i$ the following equation will be valid:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\textbf{C}(i) = \\textbf{A}(i) + \\textbf{B}(i)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We solve this problem a number of ways by example, using Fortran programs that progressively demonstrate features available to the Fortran language. Programmers from other languages will then readily be able to map concepts to their language of expertise. We choose to follow the modern 2008 standard and disregard archaic language features such as fixed source form. "

Variable names must begin with a letter and may contain letters `[a-zA-Z]`, numbers `[0-9]`, or an underscore `_`.

It is better to use predetermined types with a fixed number of bytes. The [ISO_FORTRTAN_ENV](https://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/iso_fortran_env) module defines a number of standard data types with fixed numbers of bytes. It is advisable to use these data types when having a standard number of bits to represent your data is a priority."
