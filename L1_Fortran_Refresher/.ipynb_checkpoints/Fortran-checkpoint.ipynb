    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortran was developed in the 1950's as a purpose built language for STEM applications. It is a good language to use for high performance computing because it is **easy** to understand, highly performant, and comes with a first-rate multi-dimensional array implementation. Furthermore, the language has access to both thread-level and accelerator-assisted paralleism via extensions such as OpenMP and OpenACC, as well as access to process-level parallelism with a message passing library.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is true that older versions of the Fortran standard (i.e Fortran 77 and earlier) have archaic features and idiosyncrasies that may discourage folks with training in modern coding techniques. However, like other standard programming languages such as C++, the standard is under active development, and modern Fortran programs can even be expressed in object-oriented coding styles. Some of the benefits include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Longevity, Fortran will be around as a standard for a long time.\n",
    "* First-rate multi-dimensional array implementation. Arrays of up to seven dimensions are supported, with easy **numpy-like** array access.\n",
    "* High performance. Compilers can optimize Fortran code so that it runs very quickly.\n",
    "* Compiler-optimized memory management. Compilers are free to organise and manage memory allocations in optimal ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential drawbacks include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Objects are passed to subroutines and functions **by reference** as the default. This potentially has impacts for memory safety.\n",
    "* Poor IO functionality, string handling and concatenation.\n",
    "* Memory alignment complexities when interfacing Fortran with C\n",
    "* No central website for the Fortran standard. The site [Fortran Lang](https://fortran-lang.org/) is a good resource for news and updates on Fortran.\n",
    "* Finding expertise in Fortran is difficult"

Programmers from other languages will then readily be able to map concepts to their language of expertise.

The [iso_fortran_env](https://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/iso_fortran_env) module that we included at the beginning defines a number of standard data types with a **fixed number of bytes**.

If we tried to use **D_h** after the underlying memory allocation disappears, then it would result in a memory access violation. If we tried to deallocate `D_h` after `A_h` then it would result in an error. Lets imagine that this code has been worked on for many years and has gotten rather complex. What function or subroutine is responsible for deallocating **A_h**?. When would we know that **A_h** is no longer safe to use? We could have also repointed **A_h** at something else, leaving the original allocation there but no longer accessible. Allocated memory that is no longer accessible is known as a **memory leak**.\n",

In [tensor_lib_c.f90](tensor_lib_c.f90) we use the **real32** kind from `iso_fortran_env` to make sure that the pointers always have a consistent datatype that is compatible with `float` in C. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Pass by value instead\n",
    "\n",
    "When functions are called from Fortran, remember that arguments are usually passed **by reference** instead of by **value**. This means that by default the C function will receive a **pointer** to the argument instead of the actual value of the argument. If you are trying to pass a pointer of `type(c_ptr)` then the C function by default will receive a **reference** to that pointer, which is a pointer to a pointer of type `void**`. You can modify this behaviour by adding the `value` option for each input argument in the interface. Then the **value** of each argument will be passed to the C function instead and the C function will receive a pointer of type `void*`."
