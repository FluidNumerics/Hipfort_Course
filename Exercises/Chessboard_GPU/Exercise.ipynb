    "In the file [chessboard_GPU.f90](chessboard_GPU.f90) is the Fortran source, and in the file [kernel_code.cpp](kernel_code.cpp) is the C++ source that contains the `fill_chessboard` kernel. Both source files have the basics already filled in. Your task is to insert the required Hipfort machinery to make all the pieces work. The steps required are:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Finish implementing the `fill_chessboard` kernel in [kernel_code.cpp](kernel_code.cpp).\n",
    "1. Initialize the GPU in [chessboard_GPU.f90](chessboard_GPU.f90)\n",
    "2. Allocate memory for the chessboard on the compute device at Fortran pointer `B_d`.\n",
    "3. Launch the `fill_chessboard` kernel.\n",
