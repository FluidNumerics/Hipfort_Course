Until version 3.28 of CMake the AMD backend was the only one that was supported by the HIP language. Since HIP on NVIDIA is just a thin wrapper over CUDA, an approach that seems to **work well** is to treat device code as the **HIP language** when using an AMD backend, and treat the **same source files** as the **CUDA language** when using an NVIDIA backend. Then one can define some backend-specific macros that are used by the compiler to route function calls to the right library.\n",
